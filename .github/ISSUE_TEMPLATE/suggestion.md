# **READ THIS BEFORE OPENING A REQUEST**

You will be blocked from opening further requests if you don't follow these rules.

Before opening a request, make sure a similar request doesn't already exist by searching the existing issues.

If a similar request already exists, DO NOT reply something like "i want this as well". Instead, react with üëç. Only reply if you want to add additional info.
## **One Request per issue**

Do not include multiple requests in one issue. If you are making 5 requests, make 5 separate issues
